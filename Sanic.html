<p>Sanic was made on March 31, 2010. He was created by a user named 0nyxheart.
<br><br>
He was made to be a very convincing impression of an idiotic child, but the world saw Sanic in a completely different way.
<br><br>
No big surprise, he was first seen in a fan-made game.
<br><br>
Most of Sanics' games are indie.

<p>Sanic can run up 12 times the speed of light, which is equal to 15 Lightspeeds per Sanic.</p>
<p> He can travel up to 8,047,399,548 mph. Even though he can run very fast, Sanic has a hard time controlling his speed.</p>
<p>Sanic can also summon a F5 Tornado on his command but can only do it once every stage/fight.</p>
<p>Sanic can also do Sonic's spin dash.</p>
<p>Sanic can also go MLG which turns him into a nunstoppable gaming machine of pure derpyness, but he can't control when he goes MLG or when he no longer is MLG, it's sort of a curse to him but it's still useful.</p>
<p> His MLG ability can turn Sanic into many other physical forms.</p>
<p>Each form has there own Power, Speed and Defence. Sanic has one physical form that he does not need to go MLG to use and it's his Ball form from Sanic Ball.</p>
<p> Sanic can become Ball Sonic and mess shit up.</p>
<p>He can use a Spindash more powerful than in base form or in any form.</p>
